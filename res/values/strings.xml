    <string-array name="answers">
        <item>Masq is sms encryption software. It can be used to send/receive sms messages that can only be opened with the associated key.</item>
        <item>According to wikipedia: Encryption is the process of transforming information using an algorithm to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge, usually referred to as a key.</item>
        <item>Masq is legal in the United States of America. In some other countries it is legal, but you must supply the key if prompted by law enforcement. In other countries it is flat out illegal. It is your responsibility to know the laws in your own country.</item>
        <item>Keys are placed into a file called the Keystore. This file is then encrypted with a keystore password. It is important to keep your keystore password secure because it is the main key. All of the other keys can be obtained with the main key.</item>
        <item>Masq uses AES-256 encryption.</item>
        <item>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithm (Rijndael, designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, published in 1998) that may be used by US federal departments and agencies to cryptographically protect sensitive information [3]. </item>
        <item>Yes. All encrypted Masq messages begin with an underscore ( _ ). For messages longer than 160 characters the messages are ended with a hypen ( - ).\n\nWhat if i send messages that falsely match the Masq signature?\nMasq will attempt to decrypt these messages and will result in "gibberish".</item>
        <item>Yes! This is encouraged for security\'s sake. However, Messages sent/received with an old key will no longer be readable. Instead they will be displayed as "gibberish".</item>
        <item>Yes. Disable and re-enable encryption in the "Keys and Settings".</item>
        <item>No. The keystore password is impossible to recover if lost.</item>
        <item>Yes.</item>
        <item>Add contacts in the "Keys and Settings" menu. Generate or scan keys for these contacts (This will likely be done in person). Once complete they will show up in "Encrypted SMS Messaging". All messages sent/received will be automatically encrypted/decrypted. </item>
